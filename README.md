# Microfluidic-RGB-Sensor
Our goal for this project was to create a microfluidic system that could detect the
concentration of any unknown solution with the use of an rgb sensor. For this project, we had to
detect the concentration of fluorescein in the solution given to us. Our team created a chip made of
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) along with housing that would prevent light pollution to the chip
and hold our electronic components. In order to fill the requirements of the project successfully,
our team split up and focused on specialized tasks. This included learning how to laser cut, 3D
print, code with arduino, circuit analysis, and learn chemical calibration. As we progressed
throughout these ten weeks and learned these new skills, we proceeded with the construction of the
system that would meet the design requirements.

We completed the system over a span of ten weeks. The first two weeks were spent
brainstorming a design for a system, and deciding the size of the staging wells, detection well,
waste well, and channels. After that, our mechanical and electrical hardware team spent the third
and fourth week creating a preliminary design for the chip and the housing. Our design was then
approved and we spent week five finalizing the details and modifying our design with the advice of
our advisor. Once the design was finalized, we began the fabrication process by building the
housing, cutting out the chip cover, creating the mold for the PDMS, and fabricating the PDMS
chip. We also began the coding process during the sixth week, and this continued with the
flowchart, troubleshooting, and debugging up until the final competition. We completed the
fabrication of the system during week eight, which is also when we created the stock solutions and
began calibration. This also continued until the final competition. We were able to meet our goal of
detecting the amount of fluorescein in the solutions with the RGB sensor, though our results were
not what we had expected. This could be due to an error in the fabrication of the system itself and
the equipment, or some small errors in the code.

Throughout this process we did not only gain technical knowledge in the programs we
used, but also the process of engineering. We learned that time management for this project was
extremely important, as we had deadlines for several different aspects of the project, as well as the
challenging and time consuming process of trial and error. Though we may have had brilliant ideas
that should have worked on paper, reality presented us with several challenges. However, this also
allowed us to focus on the importance of communication and teamwork, as well as working with
others in the field of engineering.
